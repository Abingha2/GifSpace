# GifSpace
Gifspace is a place where you can save your favorite gifs and come back and see them anytime!
## How to use it
Just load the website and you'll be greated with the main page. This page is filled with gifs from all kinds of different categories. These are around to help you get and idea what gifs you want to search for in the bar above.
To search is simple, just type in anyword you can think of and hit ENTER! you will then be graced with all the gifs that fit under that word or phrase.The best part is if you find a gif that you like you can add it to your favorites by clicking the pink heart in the righthand corner of the gif. It's that simple! Now when you click the favorites tab you can see all the gifs that you have favorited in one place.
## Plans
While this is the beta version the goal is to eventually have a the ablility to share gifs with others without leaving this platform.
Go on others pages and see their favorite gifs and their ultimate gif as their profile picture.
The ultimate gif button will add your top gif as your profile picture for you to proudly display for other to see.
You'll also be able to change your username font, color and even background color of your page!
There is so much more in store for this project!
